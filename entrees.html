       <td>Haitian Griot</td>
       <td>Griot is a rich, flavorful dish that is one of Haitiâ€™s most popular foods. It's quick and easy to serve at parties and family gatherings. Cubes of pork are soaked in a sour orange marinade and then slow-roasted until tender. The tender morsels are then given a final fry in oil until delectably caramelized. Griot is undoubtedly a must when it comes to Haitian food. This dish goes great with plantains and a side of pikliz (Haitian pickled vegetable relish).</td>
